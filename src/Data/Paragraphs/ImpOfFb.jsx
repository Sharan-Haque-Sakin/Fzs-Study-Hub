          Facebook is a social networking site that was launched in 2004 by Mark
          Zuckerberg. It has had a significant impact on society, with over 2.8
          billion monthly active users worldwide. In Bangladesh, Facebook has
          become one of the most popular social media platforms, with around 40
          million users. The impact of Facebook on society has been both
          positive and negative. On the positive side, it has provided a
          platform for people to connect with each other and share information.
          Facebook has also been used to raise awareness about social and
          political issues, such as the recent student protests in Bangladesh.
          However, there are also negative impacts of Facebook. One of the
          biggest concerns is the spread of misinformation and fake news. This
          can have serious consequences, particularly in countries like
          Bangladesh where social media is a major source of news for many
          people. Additionally, there are concerns about privacy and security on
          the platform, with Facebook facing criticism for its handling of user
          data. In Bangladesh, Facebook has been both a tool for social and
          political change, as well as a source of controversy. It has played a
          significant role in mobilizing protests and raising awareness about
          issues, but has also been used to spread hate speech and incite
          violence. In 2018, the government temporarily blocked access to
          Facebook in an effort to curb the spread of fake news and
          misinformation. Overall, the impact of Facebook on society is complex
          and multifaceted. While it has provided a platform for people to
          connect and share information, it has also raised concerns about
          privacy, security, and the spread of misinformation. In Bangladesh,
          Facebook has played a significant role in shaping the social and
          political landscape, but has also been the subject of controversy and
          debate.
